This is the new event-driven Queue Manager for the Huygens Remote Manager.

Communication from the QueueManager (Tcl) to PHP occurs through POSTs to
the apache web server. Communication from PHP to the QueueManager (Tcl)
occurs through socket connection on a predefined port.

= NOTATION ================================================================================

WAB   : Web-application backend
QM    : Queue Manager
HuCore: Huygens Core, processing tool

= CURRENT QUEUE MANAGER ===================================================================

- Written in PHP
- One big for loop
- 2-way communication WAB - QM via database updates
- (Limited) communication QM - HuCore through shell pipes
- QM keeps track of job queue (>= 1 server), with simple prioritization mechanism

= EVENT-DRIVEN Tcl QUEUE MANAGER ==========================================================

- Communication from QM (Tcl) to WAB (PHP) occurs through POSTs to
  the apache web server. 
- Communication from WAB to QM occurs through socket connection on
  an admin-defined port. 
- QM communicates with HuCore via persistent SSH pipes.
- New queue management?

Components:

- QM: QueueManager.tcl communicates to WAB via POSTs and to HuCore via SSH pipes 
  (host-agnostic).
- WAB: collect.php -> Collector.php catches POSTs on port 80 from QM
- WAB: Dispatcher.php communicates with QM vie socket connections (port configurable)
